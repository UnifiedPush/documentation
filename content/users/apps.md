¹ App-specific documentation should not be needed. Compatible apps should just work after [installing a UnifiedPush distributor](../distributors/).

² UnifiedPush is designed to work with any distributor. Some apps' documentation suggest particular ones but you might prefer to follow the generic advice on [installing a UnifiedPush distributor](../distributors/).

The following is a list of applications that have some work in progress regarding UnifiedPush support.

- [NeoChat](https://invent.kde.org/network/neochat/-/merge_requests/458) A Matrix client on Linux, along with [KUnifiedPush](https://invent.kde.org/libraries/kunifiedpush/), its library.
- [Molly](https://github.com/mollyim/mollyim-android) (A [Signal](https://signal.org/) fork) on Android.
