title: UnifiedPush
---
UnifiedPush is a decentralized push notification system that lets you choose the service you want to use. It’s designed to be privacy-friendly, flexible, and open — making it perfect if you want control over your push notifications.

## Quickstart guides:
* [Sunup](https://unifiedpush.org/users/distributors/sunup/): A quick and easy way to use UnifiedPush without signing up for an account.
* [ntfy](https://unifiedpush.org/users/distributors/ntfy/): A lightweight, open-source push notification service that can be used as a UnifiedPush distributor.
* [Conversations \(XMPP\)](https://unifiedpush.org/users/distributors/conversations/): A popular XMPP client that can both distribute and receive UnifiedPush notifications.
* [NextPush](https://unifiedpush.org/users/distributors/nextpush/): A push notification service designed for Nextcloud.
* [gCombat UP-Distributor](https://unifiedpush.org/users/distributors/fcm/): A simple and efficient UnifiedPush distributor designed for Android devices.

## Key benefits of UnifiedPush:
* **Open standard:** Interoperable and resilient.
* **Decentralized:** Not tied to any single company or service, reducing reliance on gatekeepers.
* **Privacy first:** Push notifications are encrypted.
* **Self-hostable:** Run your own notification server for as much control as you need.
* **User Control:** The user chooses the service they use, not the developers.

## Key features:
* **No privileged services needed:** Use lightweight services and follow least privilege policy. Works on de-Googled Android devices and custom ROMs.
* **Multiple distributors:** Choose from a [list of distributors](https://unifiedpush.org/users/distributors/).
* **Easy integration:** Developers can add UnifiedPush support to their apps with minimal effort.

## How it works
### **Step 1: App Sends Notification:** 
An app (e.g., a messaging app) sends a notification to a UnifiedPush distributor.
### **Step 2. Distributor Delivers Notification:**
The distributor (e.g., ntfy, NextPush, or a self-hosted server) receives the notification and forwards it to your device.
### **Step 3. Device Receives Notification:**
Your device gets the notification directly from the distributor, without involving Google Play Services.
