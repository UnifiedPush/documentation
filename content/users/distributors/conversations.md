## Conversations quickstart guide
### Step 1: Install Conversations
Download Conversations from one of the following sources:
* [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.siacs.conversations&pcampaignid=web_share)
* [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/eu.siacs.conversations/)
### Step 2: Set up your XMPP account
1. Open the Conversations app.
2. If you already have an XMPP account, enter your credentials (username, password, and server address).
3. If you donâ€™t have an XMPP account, you can create one directly in the app or use a provider like:
* [jabber.de](https://www.jabber.de/)
* [xmpp.jp](https://xmpp.jp/)
* [prosody.net](https://prosody.net/)
4. Complete the setup and log in.

### Step 3: Enable UnifiedPush for your XMPP account
1. Open **Conversations** and go to **Settings**.
2. Navigate to **UnifiedPush Distributor**.
3. Select **XMPP Account**
4. Select your XMPP account
5. Now push notifications for this account will use UnifiedPush

### Step 5: Set Up Conversations as a UnifiedPush distributor
1. Open the app you want to use with UnifiedPush ([check this list for compatible apps](https://unifiedpush.org/users/apps/)).
2. Look for the **Push Notification Settings** or **UnifiedPush Settings** in the app.
3. Select **Conversations** as the UnifiedPush distributer
4. Save the settings, and the app will now use NextPush to deliver push notifications.

### Step 6: Test notifications
1. Trigger a test notification from the app you chose.
2. Ensure that the notification is delivered to your device successfully.
3. If notifications are not working, check Conversations settings and ensure it has a valid **Push Server** configured.

## Self-host (optional)
In addition to a regular XMPP server, you need a UnifiedPush->XMPP Rewrite Proxy to turn UnifiedPush messages into XMPP messages. There are multiple options for rewrite proxies.
