### What are push notifications?

Your mobile device often needs to receive updates from many messaging, and sometimes other apps that provide real-time updates. Without push notifications, each app would need to contact its own server to get updates. This wastes a lot of battery power. So, push notifications were created; they allow you to receive updates from multiple apps using one network connection by routing everything through a single server.

### I'm just a user who wants push notifications for apps using UnifiedPush, what should I do?

You should visit the [user introduction](/users/intro) page to learn what UnifiedPush is and get instructions to use it.

### Which apps does UnifiedPush work with?

Apps need to support the UnifiedPush protocol before they can use self-hosted push notifications. See [the application list](/users/apps). If an app isn't in there, feel free to ask in the UnifiedPush Matrix (bridged on Libera Chat IRC) or ask the application's dev team.

### Basic description of how UnifiedPush works

### I'm an app developer who wants my users to get push notifications without Google, what should I do?

You should use the UnifiedPush [connector library](/developers/) for your framework. If it doesn't already exist for your framework/language, contributions are welcome.

### Will UnifiedPush ever work on iOS?

iOS doesn't support running services in the background, so running a UnifiedPush distributor won't be possible without jailbreaking or Apple's approval for the foreseeable future. If someone has a solution, share that in the chat.

### Can we use transport X to deliver notifications to the device?

Yes! UnifiedPush doesn't define a transport between the *provider* and the *distributor*. Just implement the UnifiedPush distributor API, and your service will be compatible with any existing app that uses UnifiedPush!

### What is the difference between UnifiedPush and OpenPush?

UnifiedPush was born in the OpenPush chat. There are some similar core ideas as well; but operationally, the projects are not related. The goals of the projects are the same, except UnifiedPush allows for various different distributors rather than one.
