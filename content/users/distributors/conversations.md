## Conversations quickstart guide

### Step 1: Install Conversations

Install the latest version of the application from one of the following sources:

* [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.siacs.conversations&pcampaignid=web_share)
* [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/eu.siacs.conversations/)

### Step 2: Set up your XMPP account

1. Open the Conversations app.
2. If you already have an XMPP account, enter your credentials (username, password, and server address).
3. If you donâ€™t have an XMPP account, you can create one directly in the app or use a provider like:
    * [jabber.de](https://www.jabber.de/)
    * [xmpp.jp](https://xmpp.jp/)
    * [prosody.net](https://prosody.net/)
4. Complete the setup and log in.

### Step 3: Enable UnifiedPush for your XMPP account

1. Open **Conversations** and go to **Settings**.
2. Navigate to **UnifiedPush Distributor**.
3. Select **XMPP Account**
4. Select your XMPP account
5. Now push notifications for this account will use UnifiedPush

### Step 4: Set up UnifiedPush in your app(s)

1. Open the app you want to use with UnifiedPush ([check this list for compatible apps](/users/apps/)).
2. Look for the **Push Notification Settings** or **UnifiedPush Settings** in the app.
3. Select **Conversation** as the UnifiedPush distributer
4. Save the settings, and the app will now use Conversation to deliver push notifications.

### Step 5: Test notifications

1. Trigger a test notification from the app you chose.
2. Ensure that the notification is delivered to your device successfully.

## Self-host (optional)

In addition to a regular XMPP server, you need a **UnifiedPush->XMPP Rewrite Proxy** to turn UnifiedPush messages into XMPP messages. There are multiple options for rewrite proxies.

### iNPUTmice's Official Rewrite Proxy

[up](https://codeberg.org/iNPUTmice/up) is a proxy written in Java by the developer of Conversations. It's server independent and works with an external XMPP server.

### Prosody mod_unified_push

[mod_unified_push](https://modules.prosody.im/mod_unified_push) is a Prosody module that turns Prosody into a complete push server.
