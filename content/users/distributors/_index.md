UnifiedPush is a standard for receiving push notifications[*](/users/faq/#what-are-push-notifications).
UnifiedPush allows you to choose between multiple implementations and servers, based on your preferences. The core UnifiedPush tools are all free and open source software.

## Definitions
* The **Distributor** is the application you install on your device to get notifications. It receives notifications and distributes them to the other applications.
* The (Push) **Provider** is the server reachable from the Internet that listens for incoming notifications for you.
* The **Distributor** is connected to the **Provider** to get the notifications.

## Install a Distributor

### Without self-hosting the server (Easy)

* [ntfy](/users/distributors/ntfy): You just need to install it.
* [UP-FCM Distributor](/user/distributors/fcm): The same as above. Just be aware that it uses Google servers.
* [Gotify](/users/distributors/gotify): You can use an open to registration server.

### Self-host the server (Difficult)

Self hosting lets you have control of the server through which you receive push notifications. You have several distributor/provider options for self-hosting:

#### [ntfy](/users/distributors/ntfy)

The ntfy server can be easily be self-hosted. It can be installed with a package, available for most linux distributions, with docker, or using the standalone binary.

#### [NextPush](/users/distributors/nextpush)

NextPush is a push server that can be hosted as a Nextcloud app. This is an easy way to self-host a push provider if you already have a Nextcloud server.

#### [Gotify](/users/distributors/gotify)

Gotify is a server that you can install to send and receive messages, including those of UnifiedPush. It requires additionnal steps to work with unifiedpush.

### Other options

#### [FCM-Distributor](/users/distributors/fcm)

If you have Google services (play store, etc.) on your Android phone, the easiest way is to use FCM-Distributor. However, this means that all your notification data is still being routed through Google.

FCM-Distributor might also be a good option for people whose phone manufacturer has set up [extremely strict battery saving](https://dontkillmyapp.com/).

#### [NoProvider2Push](/users/distributors/np2p)

NoProvider2Push needs a static IP to work, which is reachable with a VPN or public meshing network. It is mostly useful for development purposes and advanced users at this moment.

### Special Case: the embedded FCM distributor

Some applications using UnifiedPush automatically use Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging if no UnifiedPush Distributor is detected.
