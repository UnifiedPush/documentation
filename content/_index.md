title: UnifiedPush
---
UnifiedPush is a set of specifications and tools that lets the user choose how push notifications[*](/users/faq/#what-are-push-notifications) are delivered. All in a free and open source way.

## Quick start

* __I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT TO INSTALL__: [__ntfy (Android)__](/users/distributors/ntfy/)
* The same but I want to use Google for some reason: [gCompat-UP Distrib (Android)](/users/distributors/fcm/)
* I have a Nextcloud server: [NextPush (Android)](/users/distributors/nextpush/)
* I use Conversations, the XMPP client: [Conversations (Android)](/users/distributors/conversations/)
* For other options, see below.

## Getting Started

Any app can be used with any distributor:
<br><br>
<object style="max-height: 30em;" id="animation" type="image/svg+xml" data="./img/animation.svg" onload="this.parentNode.replaceChild(this.contentDocument.documentElement, this);">
</object>
<br><br><br>
This is how UnifiedPush notifications flow:
<br><br> 
<object style="max-height: 30em;" id="animation" type="image/svg+xml" data="./img/animation-flow.svg" onload="this.parentNode.replaceChild(this.contentDocument.documentElement, this);">
</object>
